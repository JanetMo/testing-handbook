# Continuous Integration

## CI/CD integration

In this chapter, we will walk you through the process of enabling code scanning
with CodeQL for your GitHub repository.

{{< hint info >}}
Code scanning is available for public GitHub repositories. Code scanning is also
available for private repositories owned by organizations with a GitHub Advanced
Security license. For more details we refer to the official documentation on
[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security).

### Code scanning with CodeQL

GitHub code scanning is a static-analysis framework powered by CodeQL. By
enabling code scanning for your repository, you will automatically be notified
about any issues detected by the framework. To enable code scanning for a GitHub
repository, navigate to "Code security and analysis" on the GitHub repository
settings page and enable "GitHub Advanced Security." This allows you to set up
code scanning with CodeQL.

{{< figure src="/code-scanning-setup.png" alt="Code scanning dialog in the GitHub settings page" >}}

The code scanning dialog allows you to set up code scanning with either a
default or custom configuration. The default configuration is a good starting
point and will enable a set of query suites based on the language used in the
repository.

The default configuration is a simple way to get started with code scanning,
but may not always work for more complex projects. In particular, if the project
contains code in a compiled language like C or C++, the automatic setup may fail
to detect the build system used by the project.

If automatic setup fails, or if you would like to use custom queries as part of
code scanning, we recommend using the advanced setup option. This will add to the repository a new
code scanning workflow configuration that can be edited to
add additional languages, custom build scripts, and new query packs.

```yaml
name: "CodeQL"

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '34 10 * * 6'

jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze

    runs-on: ${{ (matrix.language == 'swift' && 'macos-latest') || 'ubuntu-latest' }}
    timeout-minutes: ${{ (matrix.language == 'swift' && 120) || 360 }}

    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read
      security-events: write

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        language: [ 'cpp' ]
        # If your project contains more than one language supported by CodeQL you simply
        # list all of the language identifiers here. The workflow will run once for each
        # included language.

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Initializes the CodeQL tools for scanning.
    - name: Initialize CodeQL
      uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
      with:
        languages: ${{ matrix.language }}
        # If you wish to specify custom queries, you can do so here or in a config file.
        # By default, queries listed here will override any specified in a config file.
        # Prefix the list here with "+" to use these queries and those in the config file.

        # queries: security-extended,security-and-quality

    # Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages (C/C++, C#, Go, Java, or Swift).
    # If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)
    - name: Autobuild
      uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    #   If the Autobuild fails above, remove it and uncomment the following three lines,
    #   suitably modified to build the codebase.

    # - run: |
    #     echo "Run, Build Application using script"
    #     ./location_of_script_within_repo/buildscript.sh

    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
      with:
        category: "/language:${{matrix.language}}"
```

For compiled languages, you may need to update the workflow configuration by
replacing the autobuild job with a custom build command or script, as indicated
above.

### Code scanning with custom queries

To configure the query suites and query packs used by code scanning, you need to
choose the advanced option and manually specify the query packs to run. This is
done by editing the "Initialize CodeQL" section of the workflow configuration.
It is possible to specify query suites and individual queries using `queries`,
as well as published query packs using `packs`.

```yaml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
    queries: security-extended,security-and-quality
    packs: trailofbits/cpp-queries
```

This example adds `security-extended` and `security-and-quality` query suites
from GitHub, as well as the `trailofbits/cpp-queries` query pack.

### Code scanning with repository local queries

It is also possible to include queries from the current repository as part of
code scanning. For example, if the repository contains the CodeQL query
`codeql/UnhandledError.ql`, this can be run as part of the code scanning
workflow by adding the query to the workflow configuration under `queries`
as follows:

```yaml
- uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
    queries: ./codeql/UnhandledError.ql
    packs: trailofbits/cpp-queries
```

The code scanning results will now include any issues identified by the
local `UnhandledError.ql` query as well as any issues identified by the
`trailofbits/cpp-queries` query pack.

{{< hint info >}}
Note the `.` at the start of the query path. This is needed to identify the
query name as a repository relative path.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
Remember that all queries must be part of a query pack. For queries checked
in to the current repository, this means that there must be a corresponding
`qlpack.yml` file checked in to the root directory of the corresponding query
pack.

For more information on `qlpack.yml` files, see
[Creating new query packs]({{< relref "10-advanced#creating-new-query-packs" >}}).
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint info >}}
If you have more than one or two repository local queries that you would like
to run as part of CI/CD, it is probably better to install the query pack locally
using `codeql pack install` and then specify the name of the query pack directly
in the workflow configuration under `packs`.

### Triaging code scanning results

Code scanning results can be found under the "Security" tab in your repository.

It is also possible to set up branch protection rules based on code scanning
results on the repository settings page under "Code Security and Analysis."
