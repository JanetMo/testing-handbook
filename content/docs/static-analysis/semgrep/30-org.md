# Introducing Semgrep to your organization

Semgrep is a powerful static analysis tool designed to identify bugs and specific
code patterns across multiple languages. This section outlines a flexible plan
for introducing Semgrep to your organization effectively:

1. **Assess Semgrep's usability for your organization**: Determine which languages and technologies within your
 organization are supported by Semgrep.
2. **Conduct a pilot test**: Run Semgrep on a small project to evaluate its effectiveness and identify issues such
 as false positives.
3. **Train your team**: Teach developers and other relevant team members how to use Semgrep, write custom rules,
 and engage with the Semgrep community.
4. **Create an internal repository of custom rules**: Develop and maintain a repository with custom Semgrep rules
 tailored to your organization's specific needs.
5. **Incorporate Semgrep into your CI/CD pipeline**: Gradually implement Semgrep into your CI/CD pipeline by starting
 with a pilot test, followed by scheduled full scans
and, finally, diff-aware scanning on event triggers.
6. **Assign a dedicated researcher**: Allocate a team member to explore experimental features, monitor external
 repositories, and assess the value of a paid subscription.

By following this plan, you can successfully integrate Semgrep into your organization, enhancing your code's security,
readability, and overall quality.
